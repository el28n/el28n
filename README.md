## Hi there 👋

<!--
**el28n/el28n** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a community-based financial education product which incorporates a lot of social media features, video on demand and learning management system features and a whole bunch of fintech - all while focusing on security and regtech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about artificial intelligence particularly about retrieval augmented generation and large language models and agentic systems to pull off real-world workflows
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can put my problem solving skills to the test with my minimal coding knowledge which I'm somewhat embarassed about ngl
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting better with software development and cloud deployments
- 💬 Ask me about product management, content, community and team building
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-elson-joy/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a qualified dentist but ever since school I knew that I would be coding and running businesses. I took the other field because I thought it would be more challenging and I could always come back to computers anyway because that's what I was interested in.
