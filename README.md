## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a community-based financial education product which incorporates a lot of social media features, video on demand and learning management system features and a whole bunch of fintech - all while focusing on security and regtech\
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about artificial intelligence particularly about retrieval augmented generation and large language models and agentic systems to pull off real-world workflows\
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where I can put my problem solving skills to the test with my minimal coding knowledge which I'm somewhat embarassed about ngl
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting better with software development and cloud deployments
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about product management, content, community and team building
ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-elson-joy/
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a qualified dentist but ever since school I knew that I would be coding and running businesses. I took the other field because I thought it would be more challenging and I could always come back to computers anyway because that's what I was interested in.
